# TERMINAL PRACTICE

1.	The Command Line - What is it, how does it work and how do I get to one. A command line is a text based interface to our computer. We are able to enter and in return the computer will return an output feedback.
2.	Basic Navigation – To navigate terminal is important to know some basic commands to move around the system
```pwd``` – your current directory
```ls``` – gives you the list of items on your file
```cd``` – change  directory
3.	More About Files - Everything in a Linux environment is in a file, files are case sensitive
```file``` - obtain information about what type of file a file or directory is.
```ls -a``` - List the contents of a directory, including hidden files.
4.	Manual Pages - Learn how to make the most of the Linux commands you are learning. Manual pages is a way to look up the information of a specific command the command for manual pages is:
```man <here goes the command> ```
to exit manual pages type ```q```
This command searchs for all manual pages containing the given search term.
```man -k <search term>```

5.	File Manipulation - How to make, remove, rename, copy and move files and directories.
File manipulation for me is a way to organize and manage your file to be more efficient.
Making a directory: ```mkdir <folder name>```
Removing a directory: ```rmdir <folder name>```
Creating a blank file: ```touch <file name>```
Removing a file: ```rm examplefile1```
Coping a file: ```cp file2tobecopy newfile```
Move file: ```mv foo2 newplacefile/```
