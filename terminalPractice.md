# TERMINAL PRACTICE

1.	The Command-Line - What is it, how does it work and how do I get to one. A command line is a text-based interface to our computer. We are able to enter and in return, the computer will return output feedback.</br>
2.	Basic Navigation – To navigate terminal is important to know some basic commands to move around the system</br>
```pwd``` – your current directory</br>
```ls``` – gives you the list of items on your file</br>
```cd``` – change  directory</br>
3.	More About Files - Everything in a Linux environment is in a file, files are case sensitive</br>
```file``` - obtain information about what type of file a file or directory is.</br>
```ls -a``` - List the contents of a directory, including hidden files.</br>
4.	Manual Pages - Learn how to make the most of the Linux commands you are learning. Manual pages are a way to look up the information of a specific command the command for manual pages is:</br>
```man <here goes the command> ```</br>
to exit manual pages type ```q```</br>
This command search for all manual pages containing the given search term.</br>
```man -k <search term>```</br>

5.	File Manipulation - How to make, remove, rename, copy and move files and directories.</br>
File manipulation for me is a way to organize and manage your file to be more efficient.</br>
Making a directory: ```mkdir <folder name>```</br>
Removing a directory: ```rmdir <folder name>```</br>
Creating a blank file: ```touch <file name>```</br>
Removing a file: ```rm examplefile1```</br>
Coping a file: ```cp file2tobecopy newfile```</br>
Move file: ```mv foo2 newplacefile/```</br>
